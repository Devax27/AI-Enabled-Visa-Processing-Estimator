📊 AI-Enabled Visa Processing Time Prediction System
📌 Project Statement

Visa applicants often face long waiting times and uncertainty regarding the progress of their applications. This project aims to develop a predictive analytics system that estimates visa processing times based on historical data. By analyzing past application records—such as applicant country, application type, processing office, and seasonal variations—the system provides data-driven estimates of how long a visa application may take, improving transparency and applicant experience.

🎯 Project Objectives

+ Estimate visa processing times using historical data
+ Reduce uncertainty faced by visa applicants
+ Improve transparency in visa application workflows
+ Apply machine learning for predictive analytics

✅ Expected Outcomes

/Data-Driven Estimates: Predict approximate processing times for visa applications
/Trend Analysis: Identify seasonal and regional patterns in visa processing
/User-Friendly Tool: Provide an easy-to-use web-based estimator
/Improved Transparency: Reduce applicant uncertainty with data-backed predictions
